# Avatar and TTS (Text-to-Speech) API (beta)

Text-to-Speech and avatar resources are now available in private beta.

## Overview

Avatar and Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a technology for creating digital clones of real humans which can be used to create lifelike speaking videos or audio from a transcript. These resources reduce creation time and cost for professional content production.

These APIs offer automated video and audio creation at scale:

1. **Avatar API** enables you to create an avatar speaking on video from a provided transcript. You may provide audio or text input files.
2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) API** enables you to generate lifelike spoken audio from a provided transcript.
