# API Usage Notes

This doc provides details about using the TTS (Text-to-Speech) APIs, including what's currently supported, limitations and workarounds, and the current usage limits.

## Understanding limitations and workarounds

These are some known limitations of the these APIs and their workarounds:

- **TTS voice modulation**: The output may have signification modulation in pitch or voice. Regenerating the audio can often resolve this issue.
- **Limited voice controls**: Currently voice controls like emphasis, speed or pitch modulation are not supported.
- **Mispronunciation**: The audio output might mispronounce certain uncommon words or proper nouns. This can be addressed by using phonetic spellings.

## Language support

Audio generation is supported for the following languages:

- German ```(de-DE)```
- Danish (Denmark) ```(da-DK)```
- English (American) ```(en-US)```
- English (British) ```(en-GB)```
- English (Indian) ```(en-IN)```
- Spanish (Spanish) ```(es-ES)```
- Spanish (Latin America) ```(es-419)```
- Spanish (Argentina) ```(es-AR)```
- French (France) ```(fr-FR)```
- French (Canada) ```(fr-CA)```
- Hindi (India) ```(hi-IN)```
- Italianâ€¯```(it-IT)```
- Japanese (Japan) ```(ja-JP)```
- Korean (South Korea) ```(ko-KR)```
- Norwegian (Norway) ```(nb-NO)```
- Dutch (Netherlands) ```(nl-NL)```
- Portuguese (Brazil) ```(pt-BR)```
- Portuguese (Portugal) ```(pt-PT)```
- Swedish (Sweden) ```(sv-SE)```
- Chinese (Simplified) ```(zh-CN)```

Change the ```localeCode``` parameter to get the results in the desired language/accent.

## Input text specifications

**Transcript length**: Up to ```20000``` characters.

**Input Medium**: Plain text, or ```.txt``` file via a pre-signed URL.

## API render time

   2X the output audio length for TTS API.

## API parameters

| API                   | Parameter       | Default       | All values                               | Requirement |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Text-to-Speech        | Voice ID        | -             | Refer to catalog                         | Mandatory   |
|                       | Output format   | .wav          | .wav                                     | Optional    |

## Request limits per API

To be sure everyone enjoys peak performance with these APIs, Adobe sets limits on the volume, frequency, and concurrency of API calls. Adobe monitors your API usage and will contact you proactively to resolve any risks to API performance.

Be aware that these usage limits apply to your entire organization.

These are the current rate limits for API requests:

**Get Voices API**: 50 requests per minute.

**TTS API**: 10 requests per minute.

**Get Result API**: 100 requests per minute.

You may encounter a `HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests"` error if usage exceeds either the per minute or per day limits. We recommend using the `retry-after` header to determine the number of seconds you should wait before trying again.
